Welcome to the ReCurta project!  Our goal is to translate the original Curta Type I engineering diagrams into English, redraw them using CAD software, and then use those diagrams to build the first Curta calculator since 1972.

Everything produced as part of this project is being released into the public domain.  Everyone should be able to inspect, visualize, or even build their own Curta calculator; it shouldn't be fated to forever be an expensive relic on eBay.
