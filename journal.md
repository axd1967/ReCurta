Decided to start keeping a development journal, to properly document this project once it's completed.

Status
------

- All drawings for the Type I are converted from the museummura.li sources
- Each part has been named in English and cross-referenced with the others
	- Every part referenced from each manufacturing diagram is indexed
- Out of 146 part diagrams, all but 38 are fully translated; those remaining 38 have 57 individual German phrases that need to be translated
	- These have all been automatically rewritten into English
- All of this is published on Github

Next Steps
----------

- Complete translations of all of the diagrams
	- Perform final review
- Add translated diagrams to the wiki
- Find and hire CAD designers to begin translation of diagrams to modern formats
- Determine all of the different manufacturing processes that need to be used
- Calculate approximate prices for replicas
